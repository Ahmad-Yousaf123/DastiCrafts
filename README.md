Introduction:
If you want to understand the people of any country the best way is to know about their culture. And “Handicrafts are unique expressions of a particular culture or community through local craftsmanship and materials”. But unfortunately handicrafts industry in Pakistan has seen a huge decline during last two decades. There are many reasons for this decline but major reasons are the advancement of technology and trade with other countries in particular with China. According to Arthur Lewis a Nobel laureate in economics, “Trade allegedly does not foster growth because when it begins, a flood of imports of factory origin destroys the handicraft manufacturing of the less developed country: the models for this are the effects of British exports of textiles and of iron in India and Chile in the first half of the nineteenth century.” Trade itself is not bad but balance of exports and imports is very important.
The advancement of technology handicrafts industry in Pakistan has suffered a lot. There is still a big market for handmade products but because of lack of marketing most of the people do not know about talented craftsmen. Income of these artisans is very low when compared totheir skill and hard work involved in this profession.
There is no such online platform in Pakistan where customers can easily buy local handicrafts. On the other hand, these products are only available in cultural festivals. However, solution of all these problems of customers and artisans is to provide an online platform where people can buy different kind of handicrafts online. A platform where people can buy even customized products on the order. This platform will bridge that gap between customers and artisans, and it will help artisans to earn more money. Hence this could be the way to save the dying art of handicrafts in Pakistan. We named it “DASTI-CRAFTS”

In this Project, Dasti-Crafts tackles this Problems and their solutions:

	In the first category, the app shows “Trending Products. Which is designed as the most selling products of the week or month. So that users can see the trending products and can order it if they are interested.

	In the second category the “collections page” includes all the products with their images and prices so that they can see all the available products on this page.

	In the last part there is a category of “customize products”. In this section, the app is offering the customers to send the pictures with any suggestions or note of the products they want us to make and deliver at their door step. This is unique selling point of Dasti-Crafts
